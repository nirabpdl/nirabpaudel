- 👋 Hi, I’m @nirabpaudel
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. But my key interest lies in just learning and exploring new things. To be specific, I really like web designing and animation. I also like songwriting and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS and SQL. While writing this, I'm in my final year of high school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves designing and arts. Hit me up.
